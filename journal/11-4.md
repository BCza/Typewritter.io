Does this work?  Ok cool. So I'd loike to keep goint with this each day. Just for a little bet. Even if I spend like 30 minutes a day on it and just keep working that will aleast provide me with something that I'm continually working on and building on. 

It's something that I decently care about too. Could be useful to people I know which I think is super cool. Plus, how mnice is it to make ausuasdf;ljkasdf  

that you can write something code wise that could be heling someone you know.

Anyway, going to try and deploy this. Eventually I'll have to do it cfrom the CLI , but yeah.
